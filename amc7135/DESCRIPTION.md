AMC7135 Linear LED Driver Test PCB
========================================

Small test board to make sure I'm doing this right.



AMC7135 Linear LED Driver Mk 1.0 20mm
========================================

Stupid simple, 350mA constant current linear driver based on a chip that everyone seems to use but for the life of me I can't find the actual manufacturer. Includes a full blown ATTiny13 for doing PWM because it's smaller than doing a 555 circuit or some nonsense. Includes trimpot to adjust current before installation (assuming the firmware knows about this).
